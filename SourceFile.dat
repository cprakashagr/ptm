           Review of Literature
From the time the concept of text mining was introduced, much advancement in the field has taken place. Several techniques came into existence since then. This chapter presents a literature review comprising a wide range of Text Mining and Pattern Discovery topics that relate to this research work and provide the desired conceptual context for the progress of the proposed model. 
Zhong et al. (Ning Zhong, Yuefeng Li, and Sheng Tang Wu, 2012) in his work “Effective Pattern Discovery for Text Mining” talks about effective pattern discovery techniques in which to improve the effectiveness of updating the discovered patterns for finding relevant and interesting information, Pattern Taxonomy model along with processes of pattern deploying and pattern evolving is included. 
A variety of mining algorithms have been proposed by applying several data mining techniques which lead to generation of enormous patterns, though within a reasonable time frame. But not all the patterns are interesting. This paper thus presents a Knowledge discovery model to focus on how to use and update the discovered patterns effectively and then apply it to the Text mining domain. The pros and cons of Term based, Phrase based and Pattern based Text mining approaches have been briefly discussed  
The techniques proposed in last few decades comprise of association rule mining, closed pattern mining, sequential pattern mining, maximum pattern mining, and frequent item set mining. The major issue being, using these discovered knowledge (or patterns) in the field of text mining is difficult and ineffective. The author argues that not all frequent short patterns are useful. Thus, misapprehensions and misconceptions of patterns derived from data mining techniques lead to the ineffective performance.
The author He et al. (Chao He, Yu-feng Zhang, 2010) in the work titled “Research on Semantic Association Pattern Mining Model Based on Ontology” discusses that most of text association pattern mining techniques transform texts into fat bags of words representation, which does not keep safe appropriate semantics for the purpose of knowledge discover which does not satisfies the depth and accuracy of mining. Thus, in order to solve this problem, the author proposes a novel ontology ­ based semantic association pattern mining model in the paper. 
The model so proposed puts on semantic role labelling to semantic analysis so that we are able to extract the semantic relations precisely. The results of the experiments conducted reveal that the new model can acquire deep semantic knowledge easily from text database and the algorithm mentioned above has strong adaptability and scalability making  the mining  result abound  in empirical significance  in the  practical  application;  the  designed  algorithm  is  much better  than  the  existing  algorithms  in  the  patter  number, execution  time,  and  patter  quantity. 
 However,  some problems  are  also founded  during  this  study,  such  as  social role  labeller  can  be  only  for  shallow  semantic  analysis,  and the  designed  algorithm  can  be  improved  in  efficiency  and function, waiting for further research and optimization.
Shi et al. (Guoliang Shi, Yanqing Kong, 2009) in the paper “Advances in Theories and Applications of Text Mining” discusses introduction of Text Mining and its definition, and then give an overview of the process of text mining and the applications. The author focuses to shows the importance of TM in knowledge discovery and highlights the up-coming challenges of document mining and the opportunities it offers.
Sanchez et al. (D.Sanchez, M. J. Martin-Bautista, I. Blanco, C. Justiciadelatorren, 2008) in the work titled “Text Knowledge Mining: An Alternative to Text Data Mining” introduced an alternative view of text mining and review several alternative views proposed by different authors. They propose a classi?cation of text mining techniques into two main groups: techniques based on inductive inference, that we call text data mining (TDM, comprising most of the existing proposals in the literature), and techniques based on abductive inference, that we in simple terms call as text knowledge mining (TKM). 
Further, discussion about the possibilities and challenges of TKM techniques were done. They also discuss about the application of existing theories in possible future research in this ?eld. 
This new proposal opens a wide range of possibilities in text mining. The application of non-inductive inference techniques that, remarkably, take into account a richer representation of the semantic content of text, leads to new types of text mining applications that can take advantage of the extensive available literature in the field of processing natural text or language, knowledge representation, and reasoning as well.
Diao et al. (Lili Diao, Mingyu Lu, Keyun Hu, Yuchang Lu, Chunyi Shi, 2002) in the paper “New Boosting Algorithms for Text Categorization” describes the concept that AdaBoost.SZ is a boosting method specifically designed for solving multi-class, multi-label text categorization problems. Fabrizio Sebastiani et al. provided another idea to improve these base classifiers: combining two or more weak hypothesis as a single base classifier.
The problem mainly specified in this is that the amount of hypothesis selected to combine is determined not by their importance, but by the boosting iteration times already performed. 
This paper proposes two dynamical ways for combining any number of hypotheses according to their importance. Experimental results show that the new ideas do improve the performance of boosting. They discussed some ideas for improving the performance of boosting algorithm with simple decision trees as its base classifiers employed by multi-class multi-label text categorization tasks. 
 A series of experiments were conducted to examine the performance of newly devised algorithms. The experimental results show that they are beneficial to improve the performance of boosting used for solving text categorization problems.
Wong et al. (Pak Chung Wong, Wendy Cowley, Harlan Foote, Elizabeth Jurrus, 2000) in the paper “Visualizing Sequential Patterns for Text Mining” discusses that mining of sequential patterns is designed to find patterns of discrete events that frequently happen in the same arrangement along a timeline. Like association and clustering, the mining of sequential patterns is among the most popular knowledge discovery techniques that apply statistical measures to extract useful information from large datasets. 
As our computers become more powerful, we are able to mine bigger datasets and obtain hundreds of thousands of sequential patterns in full detail. With this vast amount of data, we argue that neither data mining nor visualization by itself can manage the information and reflect the knowledge effectively. Subsequently, we apply visualization to augment data mining in a study of sequential patterns in large text corpora. The result shows that we can learn more and more quickly in an integrated visual data mining environment. 
This paper presents data mining and visualization techniques for discovery of sequential patterns from large datasets. We conclude that the strengths of the two approaches can compensate for each other’s weaknesses. We then introduce a powerful visual data mining environment that contains a data-mining engine to discover the patterns and their support values and visualization front-end to show the distribution and locality of the patterns. 
The result shows that we can learn more and more quickly in such an integrated visual data-mining environment. The main focus or the long-term goal is to integrate many of our tools and techniques such as association rules into a single visual data mining environment that provides user-friendly navigation, in-depth association and implication analysis, time sequence analysis, hypothesis explanation, and document summarization.
Lam et al. (Wai Lam, Miguel Ruiz, and Padmini Srinivasan, 1999) in the paper titled “Automatic Text Categorization and Its Application to Text Retrieval” focussed on developing an automatic text categorization approach and investigate its application to text retrieval. The categorization approach is derived from a combination of a learning paradigm known as instance-based learning and an advanced document retrieval technique known as retrieval feedback. 
The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of categorization approach using two real-world document collections from the MEDLINE database. Next, they investigated the application of automatic categorization to text retrieval. The experiments done clearly indicate that automatic categorization improves the retrieval performance compared with no categorization.  
They further demonstrated that the retrieval performance using automatic categorization achieves the same retrieval quality as the performance using manual categorization.  Furthermore, detailed analysis of the retrieval performance on each individual test query is provided.
Pissinou et al. (N. Pissinou, R. Benton, B. Bhargyavati, S.  Kurkovsky) in the journal “A Roadmap to the Utilization of Intelligent Information Agents: Are Intelligent Agents the link between the Database and Artificial Intelligence Communities?” puts focus on the use of intelligent agents to gather, filter, and fuse information in the database domain, and as it pertains to agent security, agent communication, and information search and retrieval methods.  It is  intended  as  a  roadmap for answering  the question  “are intelligent  agents  the link between  the  database and  the  artificial intelligence communities? 
The authors discusses that the future  offers  an  unlimited  scope  for  research in agent  technology,  and more  specifically in mobile and wireless information systems and mobile agents. The integration of  artificial intelligence and database system  communities  can  result  in  some  fundamental solutions for information searching,  filtering and gathering,  protocol  communication  and  negotiation  with the main  task  of  minimizing  database  searches  and solving semantic heterogeneity  issues.
Sukanya et al. (M.Sukanya, S.Biruntha, 2012) in the paper titled “Techniques on Text Mining” describes text mining as an extension of Data mining which discovers previously unknown information from different sources of data.  
Further the framework of text mining with techniques is discussed as well as the limitations and benefits have been taken into consideration.
Jusoh et al. (Shaidah Jusoh and Hejab M. Alfawareh, 2012) in their work “Techniques, applications and challenging issues in Text Mining”, describes that for data extraction, the tool is a text mining system which has the capability to analyse large quantities of natural language text and detects lexical and linguistic usage patterns in an attempt to extract meaningful and useful information. 
They discussed the fundamental methods for text mining being natural language processing (NLP) and information extraction (IE) techniques. The focus has been given on fundamental methods for conducting text mining. A brief review on application domains has been presented. The purpose of this section is to give an overview to a reader on how text mining systems can be used in real life. The paper also addressed the most challenging issue in developing text mining systems.
Hotho et al. (Andreas Hotho, Andreas Nurnberger, Gerhard Paab, 2005) in the paper “A Brief Survey of Text Mining”, in their work says that the enormous amount of information stored in unstructured texts cannot simply be used for further processing by computers, which typically handle text as simple sequences of character strings. Therefore, speci?c (pre-) processing methods and algorithms are required in order to extract useful patterns. 
Text mining refers generally to the process of extracting interesting information and knowledge from unstructured text and this paper focuses on methods, their properties and their application to speci?c problems. Even though, it was impossible to describe all algorithms and applications in detail within the (size) limits of an article, we think that the ideas discussed and the provided references should give the interested reader a rough overview of this ?eld and several starting points for further studies.
Kumar et al. (Lokesh Kumar, Parul Kalra Bhatia, 2013) in the journal “Text mining: concepts, process and applications ”, considers that the  term  ?text  mining  is  commonly  used  to  denote  any  system that analyses large quantities of natural language text and detects lexical or linguistic usage patterns in an attempt to extract probably useful (although only probably correct) information. 
Taking about text analysis, they say it involves information retrieval, information extraction, data mining techniques including association and link analysis, visualization and predictive analytics. The paper discussed the concept, process and applications of text mining, which can be applied in multitude areas such as web mining, medical, resume filtration, etc. It also enlightens the hidden potential that lies in the field of text mining and motivated to explore it further.
Agrawal et al. (Rashmi Agrawal, Mridula Batra, 2013) in the journal titled “A Detailed Study on Text Mining Techniques”, puts focus on the study of the concept of Text Mining and various techniques used in it. It also describes the major ways in which text is mined when the input is plain natural language, rather than partially-structured Web documents.
In structured text they have discussed how internal documents structure and external structure is mined which gives explicit hypertext links between documents.
